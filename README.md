## About me

![BOHDAN FEDOROV](./images/photo.png)

For the last 3.5 years, I have been working as a web developer, before that I studied to become a software engineer for mobile web applications. Now I work as a DevOps, developing a full stack application, and deploying to servers.

I find ways to solve and implement from a business idea to a deployed solution Constantly learning how to find the best business solutions, sometimes not just about code, but also about business intelligence.

Have experience as a technical lead of a project with 6+ developers, decomposing business requirements into simple tasks for other developers

I already have experience working with AI technologies: OpenAI, T5-model, and Leonardo Ai (a little hate copilot for coding).
